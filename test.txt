insert -> add -> commit -> push ->

git clone (origin addres)
git add testt.txt[goes to staging area]
git commit -m "updated changes"[working folder to git copy folder]
git push origin main[now pushing to main origin]


created a file in git :
Git -> vs or any editor
 
 git clone (origin addres)[entire file]
 git pull[files added after cloning can be pulled]

 created a folder in local :
 creating a git folder in the local folder

 git init
 git remote add origin https://github.com/Manisankarrr/rep2.git
 [since no origin is created for this folder we manually create a rep2 repository in github and use this command to check and connect the origin]


 
what is the use of branch?
    main branch have the main code 
    workers create a new branch to work and then push their work to main branch


create branch manually in git 

git branch [displays - master or main]
 if branch:
    git push origin master
 if main
    git push origin main

To change from master to main:

    git branch -M main
 

 changing it from main branch to another :

 git branch-a [view status of branch]

    git pull to update in local

    git checkout branch1[to change contents to this branch1]

To merge the code which workers created after branching their own
    git checkout main(opening main)
    opening main and then connecting to branch1
    git merge branch1(merging branch1 to main)
[merge comment is only can be used when we create a project since in company project we dont have access to it
 her comes the pull request]

to create a new branch through terminal:
    git branch branchname
    git checkout branchname(open)
    git push origin branchname(to push)


what are all the error's occur while merging:
    conflict - same file has different content may cause conflict this occurs to the merge acceptor branch(mostly main)
